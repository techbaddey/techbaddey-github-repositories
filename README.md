# Bright's GitHub Repositories' Fetch
 [View Project Demo Here](https://my-github-repo.vercel.app/)

This is a simple Vue web application that fetches all the repositories owned by me and displays them on a new page as a list item. The application also provides a detailed view of a specific repository when clicked from the list. The repository details include the repository name, description, number of stars, forks, link to the repo and the primary language used in the repository.

The application uses Vue Router to manage the navigation between the home page and the repository details page. It also includes a wildcard route to catch 404 pages when an invalid URL is entered.
